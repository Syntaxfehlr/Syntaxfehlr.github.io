        Skills:
        - Analytical thinking, problem solving, systems thinking, interdisciplinary thinking
        - sensing (mediating, listening),  maximizing others, introspection/self reflection, leading if necessary 

        Weaknesses (at least the ones I'm currently perceiving most and working on):
        - switching modes (eg. Analytical/emotional, German/English, business/casual, 
        - influence of demotivators => solving root cause


         Technical Skills:
         - Mechanical design (CAD, statics/kinematics/dynamics, constraining solution space -> weighting solution properties -> implementing solution)
         - Prototyping 
         - Fundamentals of manufacturing techniques (I'd say the tower is like 3/7 built considering the stuff I know of)
         - Fundamentals of material science
         - Fundamentals of electronics (scuffed currently)
         - Basic/Intermediate programming (python/Matlab/C++, without LLMs)
         -  Fundamentals of Chemical engineering and biotech
         - Fundamentals + something of data science and AI 
         - Technical writing/drawing


        Stuff I've done in the past and present:
        - Product development projects for Attacan
        - Networking Trip to Vietnam (Attacan, talking to suppliers and visiting factories)
        - Fast AI course (first half, multiple small AI projects, application in University project 
        - some small engineering projects (3D printed card shuffler, repair jobs, building an open source CNC mill)
        - University Projects: Pred. machine maintenance using recurrence plots, LCAs, processing mechanical recycled plastics (PE/PP), Development of a legacy boardgame teaching calculus, ...)
